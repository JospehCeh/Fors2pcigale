CIGALE hands-on session
=======================
:sectnums:
:source-highlighter: rouge
:Date: July 2021

This repository contains the material and documentation for the CIGALE hands-on
session of the link:https://ismgalaxies2021.sciencesconf.org/[International
Summer School on the Interstellar Medium of Galaxies, from the Epoch of
Reionization to the Milky Way].

## Getting the hands-on repository

First, your must get the content of this repository.  The easiest way to do it
is to use `git`:

[source, shell]
----
$ git clone https://gitlab.lam.fr/cigale/teaching_materials/gism_2021.git
$ cd gism_2021
----

You can also download an archive of the repository with the download at the top
of link:https://gitlab.lam.fr/cigale/teaching_materials/gism_2021/[this
page] (at the left of the clone one).

We may update the repository before the school starts; so it's better to use the
`git` method and pull the changes when the hands-on session starts.

## Setting up the environment

First, we need a Python environment with CIGALE installed for the hands-on
session.  We are presenting two ways to ways to install the needed packages:
using `conda` and using `pip`.  If you are *new to Python* or are already using
Conda / Anaconda, use the first method.  If you are already using Python without
Conda, you can follow the second one.

### Setting up the environment using `conda`

#### Pre-requisites

You need to have Conda installed.  Conda is a cross-platform package manager for
Python but also for other languages like R, Ruby, etc.  It allows you to create
isolated environments to work in.

If you don't have Conda installed, we advise you to use the _miniconda_
installer you can download from
link:https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html[this page].  While you can
use any of the _miniconda_ version, we suggest you get the last PythonÂ 3
version.

This installer will guide you during the installation process.

#### Creating the environment

We are creating a `ism2021` environment in which we are installing everything
needed for the hands-on session.

[source, shell]
----
$ conda create --name ism2021 python=3.9
$ conda activate ism2021
$ conda install numpy scipy astropy sqlalchemy configobj matplotlib jupyterlab ipympl
----

As you can see, before using an environment with conda, you first have to
activate it.  You must activate the `ism2021` before installing CIGALE and
before running the hands-on session.

Once you activate en environment in your terminal, you _stay_ in this
environment for the terminal session.  You should see the name of the
environment in your command prompt.

You can now switch to the section dealing with CIGALE installation.

### For those preferring regular `pip`

If you are not using `conda` and prefer to use directly `pip` (because you are
using _virtualenvs_ or _pyenv_ for instance) you must have a Python 3.8 or 3.9
environment.  Installing CIGALE will pull all its dependencies, but you still
have to install _Jupyterlab_ to display the notebooks.

[source, shell]
----
$ pip install jupyterlab ipypml
----

## Installing CIGALE

We are installing CIGALE from its sources we get from LAM's Gitlab.

[NOTE]
===============================
Building CIGALE takes a lot of temporary space.  That's why we use `TMPDIR=.` to
use the local directory for temporary file storage during install.
===============================

[source, shell]
----
$ curl -O https://gitlab.lam.fr/cigale/cigale/-/archive/ism_school_2021/cigale-ism_school_2021.tar.bz2
$ TMPDIR=. pip install ./cigale-ism_school_2021.tar.bz2
----

It will take some time to build the database and install CIGALE.  Once this is
finished, you can delete the `cigale-ism_school_2021.tar.bz2` as it's not used
anymore.

[NOTE]
===============================
If the installation using this method fails because there is not enough disk
space or memory, you can install it in _editable_ mode.

[source, shell]
----
$ tar xf cigale-ism_school_2021.tar.bz2
$ cd cigale-ism_school_2021
$ pip install -e .
$ python database_builder/__init__.py
----

In that case, you *must not* delete the `cigale-ism_school_2021` folder (but you
can delete the `tar.bz2` file).
===============================

## CIGALE SED Buiding Introduction

The notebook `cigale_introduction.ipynb` is an introduction to how CIGALE build
the SEDs.  To display and execute it, you must run the `jupyter lab` command
inside the hands-on repository, this will spawn a browser and you can select the
notebook file in the file browser at the left.

## Exercice run

The `exercise` folder contains the catalogue of the KINGFISH galaxies that is
used for the hands-on session.  The documentation of the session is in
`hands_on_project_CIGALE.pdf`.  Open a terminal into the `exercise` folder and
activate the `ism2021` environment before proceeding with the session.

## Manual fitting

With the notebook `cigale_manual_fitting.ipynb` you can play and try to manually
adjust the KINGFISH galaxies you worked on in the exercise run.  It's also
a good way to further explore the effect on the fit of the SED parameters.

## Cleaning up things...

As the CIGALE installation takes a lot of space, you may want to remove the
`ism2021` environment after the session.  To do this, execute this command:
`conda env remove -n ism2021`.
